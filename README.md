Facebot
=======

Use a nodebot to find all the faces, and take pictures of them.

![Example Picture](/example.jpg)

Use:
- Install dependencies (and OpenCV)
- connect to nodebot
- run script

To Do:

- Clean up code.
- Package it into an npm module?
- Change the code, so it finds small faces, then moves towards them for a good photo, before moving onto the next one.
